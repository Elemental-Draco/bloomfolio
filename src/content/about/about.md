If you can pry me away from VS Code, you might find me studying up on my Japanese, yelling at a video game screen, binge watching anime, lifting at the gym, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I thrive on tackling fresh challenges and solving real world problems, and I can't help but to involve that in my hobbies as well.
